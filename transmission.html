      <font size="5">Synology configuration for Transmission</font>
    </strong>
    <br><br>If you have issues installing the package from the Package Center and get
    an error saying port 9091 is in use, do the following by SSHing into your Synology
    NAS.<br><em>sudo servicetool --remove-configure-file --package transmission.sc</em><br>Then
    try to reinstall. If you get another error, then do the following:<br><em>sudo rm
    /usr/local/etc/services.d/transmission.sc<br>
    </em>The application should install and update appropriately.<br><br>The configuration
    location for the Transmission settings.json file is located here:<br><em><a><b>/volume1/@appdata/transmission/settings.json</b></a><br>
    </em>There is another location, but this is NOT the correct location: <a>/volume1/@appstore/transmission/var/settings.json</a><br>This
    location is just the original file which is not modified.<br>To make changes to
    the correct file, you need to edit <em><a><b>/volume1/@appdata/transmission/settings.json</b></a><br>
    </em>I use vi to edit the files, but others use nano.<br><em><b>sudo vi <a>/volume1/@appdata/transmission/settings.json</a></b><br>
    <br>
    </em>
    <strong>
      <font color="#ff0000">*** A word of note, make sure you STOP the service before
      making changes to the settings.json file. ***</font><br>
    </strong>
    If Tranmission is runnining, the file will change and possibly override your settings.
    Do the following to make sure your settings are saved. <br>1. Stop Transmission
    and then edit the settings.json file. <br>2. Save the file <br>3. Start up Transmission
    and your new settings should be updated Hopefully this will help someone else who's
    had issues. <br><br>I was having permission issues using docker and I think I know
    why.<br>When I installed Transmission from the Synology Package center it renamed
    some of my accounts.<br>I had created a sc-transmission group. The package installer
    renamed it to <b>sc-transmission__PKG_</b><br>Notice it has two underscores __ then
    PKG and then another underscore. __PKG_<br>I bet this is why I was getting permissions
    issues, but who knows, this is a very odd group which Tranmission created. The good
    news is Transmission works. <br><br>If you want to review the Transmission logs
    you run this command:<br><em><b>sudo tail -f </b></em><a><em><b>/volume1/@appdata/transmission/transmission.log</b></em></a><br>To
    make it easier to view the logs try this:<br><em><b>ln -s </b></em><a><em><b>/volume1/@appdata/transmission/transmission.log</b></em></a><em>
    transmission.log</em><br>then: <em></em>
    <strong>
      <br><br>
    </strong>
    You could alias it as well by adding it to your .bashrc file and then: source .bashrc,
    but that's making this slightly more advanced for normal users.<br><br>For a bonus
    you can run the following command to update the web UI to give you slighly more
    options.<br><em><b>sudo wget https://github.com/ronggang/transmission-web-control/raw/master/release/install-tr-control.sh
    --no-check-certificate</b></em><br><em><b>sudo bash install-tr-control.sh</b> <br>
    <br>
    </em>You will now have a newer updated UI and if you want to change back you have
    the option to revert
