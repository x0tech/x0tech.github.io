    If you have issues installing the package from the Package Center and get an error
    saying port 9091 is in use, do the following:<br><em></em>
    <strong></strong>
    <br>Then try to reinstall. If you get another error, then do the following:<br><em></em>
    <strong></strong>
    <br>The application should install and update appropriately.<br><br>The configuration
    location for the Transmission settings.json file is located here:<br><em><a></a></em>
    <strong></strong>
    <br>There is another location, but this is NOT the correct location: <a>/volume1/@appstore/transmission/var/settings.json</a><br>This
    location is just the original file which is not modified.<br>To make changes to
    the correct file, you need to edit <em><a></a></em>
    <strong></strong>
    <br>I use vi to edit the files, but others use nano.<br><em></em>
    <strong></strong>
    <a></a>

    <strong>
      <font color="red">*** A word of note, make sure you STOP the service before making
      changes to the settings.json file. ***</font>
    </strong>
    <br>If Tranmission is runnining, the file will change and possibly override your
    settings. Do the following to make sure your settings are saved.<br>1. Stop Transmission
    and then edit the settings.json file.<br>2. Save the file<br>3. Start up Transmission
    and your new settings should be updated Hopefully this will help someone else who's
    had issues.<br><br>I was having permission issues using docker and I think I know
    why.<br>When I installed Transmission from the Synology Package center it renamed
    some of my accounts.<br>I had created a sc-transmission group. The package installer
    renamed it to sc-transmission__PKG_<br>Notice it has two underscores __ then PKG
    and then another underscore. __PKG_<br>I bet this is why I was getting permissions
    issues, but who knows, this is a very odd group which Tranmission created. The good
    news is Transmission works.<br><br>For a bonus you can run the following comand
    to update the web UI to give you slighly more options.<br><em></em>
    <strong></strong>
    <br><em></em>
    <strong></strong>
    <br><br>You will now have a newer updated UI and if you want to change back you
    have the option to revert
